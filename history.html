    The first written records of the region come from Arab traders in 
    the 9th and 10th centuries. In medieval times, the region was 
    dominated by the Trans-Saharan trade and was ruled by the Mali 
    Empire. In the 16th century, the region came to be ruled by the
     Songhai Empire. The first Europeans to visit the Gambia River were
      the Portuguese in the 15th century, in 1447, who attempted to
       settle on the river banks, but no settlement of significant size 
       was established. Descendants of the Portuguese settlers remained 
       until the 18th century. In the late 16th century, English merchants
        attempted to begin a trade with the Gambia, reporting that it was
         "a river of secret trade and riches concealed by the Portuguese."
