        The Gambia is a very small and narrow African country with the
         border based on the Gambia River. The country is less than 48
          kilometres (30  mi) wide at its greatest width. The country's 
          present boundaries were defined in 1889 after an agreement
           between the United Kingdom and France. It is often claimed 
           by Gambians that the distance of the borders from the Gambia
            River corresponds to the area that British naval cannon of the
             time could reach from the river's channel.
