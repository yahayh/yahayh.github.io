    <p>
        The economy of the Gambia is heavily reliant on agriculture.
        [15] The Gambia has no significant mineral or other natural 
        resources, and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of 
        the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood.
         Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of 
         peanuts, fish, and animal hides.
